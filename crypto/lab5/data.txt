It is a symmetric key cipher i.e. they use the same key for both encryption and decryption. In this article, we are going to demonstrate key generation for s-des encryption and decryption algorithm. We take a random 10-bit key and produce two 8-bit keys which will be used for encryption and decryption.

Key Generation Concept: In the key generation algorithm, we accept the 10-bit key and convert it into two 8 bit keys. This key is shared between both sender and receiver.
